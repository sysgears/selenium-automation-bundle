# Selenium Automation Bundle

The Selenium Automation Bundle is a seed project for Selenium test automation with TestNG and Selenide, and it provides 
you with a good starting point for configuring a local environment for writing tests. 

> This is an introduction to the Selenium Automation Bundle. You can also read a 
[dedicated overview](https://github.com/sysgears/selenium-automation-bundle/blob/docs/docs/OVERVIEW.md) to know more 
about the employed concepts and technologies.

## Features

 - Automatic initialization of Selenium WebDriver for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari
 - Structured test reports with detailed logs of execution using Allure
 - Integrated Selenide for handling dynamic behavior on your pages and for writing less code in page objects
 - Getting test data from YAML files with built-in annotations
 - A convenient interface for creating command-line commands
 - Support for Groovy to write concise test classes and page objects

## Technologies

* Selenium
* Selenide
* TestNG
* Allure
* aShot
* Groovy

## Installing the Bundle and Running the Tests

In this section, you're going to install the Selenium Automation Bundle on your computer, run the tests, and view the 
test results in the browser.

## Prerequisites

### Java

Install Java 8 or higher.

### Google Chrome

Google Chrome is the default browser that we’re using with the Selenium Automation Bundle. Make sure that you have the 
latest version of Chrome before you run the demo tests later in this guide.

### IDE

You can use any favorite IDE such as Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans when working with the bundle. 

## Clone the Selenium Automation Bundle

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sysgears/selenium-automation-bundle.git
```

## Run the Demo Tests

There are several test examples to help you get started. To run them, change the current working directory:

```bash
$ cd selenium-automation-bundle
```

And now you can run the demo tests using the command below:

```bash
$ ./gradlew
```

> Note that if you're using Windows, you should execute `gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`.

The [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) will take it from here: It will run 
the demo tests in Chrome and show a confirmation in the terminal that the tests were completed. During the execution of 
demo tests, Chrome will automatically open and close several times.

Once the tests are completed, you can generate and serve a report to your default browser by running the following 
commands:

```bash
$ ./gradlew downloadAllure
$ ./gradlew allureServe
```

Congratulations, you've just started using the Selenium Automation Bundle!

## Project Structure

The directory structure of the Selenium Automation Bundle is typical of Groovy-based projects generated with Gradle. 
Here's what the project looks like (note that several unimportant directories aren't shown in the diagram):

```
selenium-automation-bundle
├── allure/
├── .gradle
├── build
    ├── allure-results/
    ├── reports/
        ├── allure-report
        └── tests/
            └── test/
├── gradle/
├── src/
    ├── main/
        ├── groovy/com/sysgears/seleniumbundle/
            ├── core/
            ├── pagemodel/
            └── Main.groovy
        └── resources/
            └── config/ApplicationProperties.groovy
    └── test/
        ├── groovy/com/sysgears/seleniumbundle/
            ├── common/
            ├── listeners/
            └── tests/
        └── resources/
            ├── data/
            └── testng.xml
├── .gitignore
├── build.gradle
├── gradle.properties
├── gradlew
├── gradlew.bat
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── settings.gradle
```

In the table below, we discuss only the directories and files that you'll use when writing tests with the bundle.

| Directory or File | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `build/`    | The build code is generated to this directory. You can find test reports here too. |
| `build/reports/` | The `reports` directory will contain the test reports generated by TestNG and Allure in their own directories - `./tests/test/` and `./allure-report/` respectively. |
|----------|----------|
| `src/main/` | *Bundle Code* |
| `src/main/.../core/` | Contains all the custom code of the bundle. You don't need to change anything in `core/` unless you want to add a very specific behavior for your test project. |
| `src/main/.../pagemodel/` | Contains default page objects. Put all your page objects for the HTML pages under test in this directory. |
| `src/main/.../Main.groovy` | `Main.groovy` is the entry point of our mechanism to work with CLI commands. |
| `src/main/resources/config/ApplicationProperties.groovy` | The global application properties. You need to change this file to set, for example, the base URL for your application under test. |
|----------|----------|
| `src/test/` | *Test-Related Code* |
| `src/test/.../common/` | The `common` directory contains the basic test classes such as `BaseTest`, `FunctionalTest`, and others. They provide a few methods with common functionality, and you can add more methods to fulfill specific test tasks. |
| `src/test/.../listeners/` | The `AllureListener` class is stored in this directory; this class implements functionality to add screenshots to failed tests. Use this class in your test methods. |
| `src/test/.../tests/` | This directory will contain all kind of tests you'll write for your application - functional, end-to-end, integration, and UI tests. |
| `src/test/resources/data/` | The directory to put the test data repeated in many tests. Test data is usually stored in YAML files.  |
| `src/test/resources/testng.xml` | You may need to configure TestNG manually for your tests, so update `testng.xml` when necessary or even add other XML files with TestNG configurations in the same folder. |
|----------|----------|
| `.gitignore` | Git configuration to ensure that some files will not be committed to source control. | 
| `build.gradle` | The Gradle file containing build configurations. In this file, you will find the list of dependencies, plugins, and Gradle tasks. |
| `gradle.properties` | Contains various project properties. For example, you can change test groups to run in this file. |
| `LICENSE` | License information. |
| `README.md` | The document you are reading now. |

## What's Next?

After running the demo tests, you'll want to know _how_ they were created. If you're an experienced QA specialist
familiar with Selenium, Selenide, and TestNG, you can read an 
[introduction to writing tests](https://github.com/sysgears/selenium-automation-bundle/blob/docs/docs/intro_to_writing_tests.md)
and start testing your application right away. But if you need more information, you're welcome to read an
[advanced guide](https://github.com/sysgears/selenium-automation-bundle/blob/docs/docs/detailed_guide_to_writing_tests.md).

Here are several other topics you might be interested in:

* Testing of the user interface
* Data-driven testing
* Reporting with Allure
